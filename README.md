# MyReads Project

A personal library app with three shelves ('Want to read', 'Reading', 'Read').
Additionally you can search for new books using an async api.
The app is implemented using React components.


## How to get started
To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`


## Backend API
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
